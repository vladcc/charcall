charcall allows you to associate a character, or a byte value, with a
callback function. Then you can associate a string with the resulting
callback table. This, in turn, allows you to execute the callbacks while
iterating over the string. Effectively, this turns out as execution of custom
actions specified by the string - a character based language.
